HR Employee Distribution Analysis Report

Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of workforce distribution patterns across our organization of 13,000+ employees. Key findings reveal a predominantly male workforce (75%), with an average tenure of 8.9 years. Geographic data shows 65% of employees are concentrated in the Midwest region, while department-level analysis highlights higher termination rates in Auditing (0.16) and Legal (0.13). The 25-34 age group emerges as both the largest demographic segment and the cohort with the highest attrition rates. These insights were developed through advanced SQL data extraction and Power BI visualization techniques, providing actionable intelligence for strategic HR decision-making.

Workforce Demographics
Our analysis reveals significant patterns in employee composition:

Gender distribution shows male employees constitute 75% (13,000) of the workforce, compared to 22% female (8,900) and 3% non-conforming (500). This disparity is particularly pronounced in Engineering departments, where female representation drops to just 18%.

Racial/ethnic diversity data indicates White employees represent 58% of the total workforce. Asian employees demonstrate the highest retention rate at 92%, suggesting potential best practices in engagement that could be replicated across other demographic groups.

Age distribution analysis identifies the 25-34 cohort as our largest demographic segment (5,000 employees), accounting for 38% of total headcount. This group also shows concerning attrition trends with a 0.18 termination rate, signaling a need for targeted retention strategies.

Geographic Distribution
Employee location data presents both opportunities and challenges for talent strategy:

The Midwest region serves as our primary talent hub, with Wisconsin (2,900), Michigan (2,800), and Illinois (2,800) collectively housing 65% of our workforce. Southern states like Oklahoma and Kentucky show significantly lower representation at less than 8% each.

This concentration creates potential vulnerabilities in business continuity and limits access to diverse talent pools. Expanding remote work policies could help mitigate these risks while improving our ability to recruit from underrepresented regions.

Department-Level Insights
Critical findings emerge when examining workforce metrics by business unit:

Termination rates vary significantly across departments, with Auditing (0.16) and Legal (0.13) showing the highest attrition. These rates exceed organizational averages and warrant immediate investigation through enhanced exit interviews and engagement surveys.

Gender distribution patterns reveal stark contrasts between functions. While Engineering maintains 82% male representation, Human Resources shows inverse trends at 65% female. These imbalances suggest opportunities for cross-departmental mentoring programs and targeted recruitment initiatives.

Tenure duration analysis highlights Legal department employees boast the longest average tenure at 12.4 years, compared to just 5.2 years in Marketing. Understanding the drivers behind these differences could inform retention strategies across all business units.

Technical Methodology
The analysis leveraged a robust data pipeline:

Data extraction involved complex SQL queries from our HRIS database, including calculated fields for age groups derived from birth dates and tenure computed from hire dates.

Transformation processes standardized demographic categories across multiple source systems and resolved data quality issues in the race/ethnicity fields (92% completion rate).

Advanced analytics incorporated DAX measures in Power BI to create dynamic metrics like rolling retention rates and diversity indices. The age group classification logic used conditional statements to categorize employees into five-year cohorts.

Strategic Recommendations
1. Diversity Enhancement Initiatives

Implement targeted campus recruitment at women's colleges for technical roles

Establish diversity metrics as part of departmental performance scorecards

Launch unconscious bias training for all hiring managers

2. Retention Program Development

Create mentorship programs tailored to 25-34 year old employees

Conduct stay interviews in high-attrition departments

Review compensation equity across all demographic groups

3. Workforce Planning Improvements

Develop succession plans for our aging 55-64 demographic (average tenure 14.2 years)

Pilot remote work options to access new geographic talent pools

Implement predictive analytics to identify flight risks before attrition occurs

Conclusion
This analysis provides data-driven insights into our workforce composition, highlighting both strengths and opportunities for improvement. The significant gender disparities in technical roles, geographic concentration risks, and department-specific attrition patterns all demand strategic attention. By implementing the recommended initiatives, we can build a more diverse, engaged, and stable workforce capable of supporting long-term organizational success. Future analyses should incorporate additional data sources like employee engagement surveys to develop more holistic understanding of these dynamics.
