# HR Employee Distribution Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of employee demographics and distribution across the organization, leveraging SQL for data preparation and Power BI for visualization. The solution implements a robust ETL pipeline from SQL Server to Power BI, enabling advanced analytics and interactive visualizations.

## 1. Project Overview

### Issue Statement
The organization needed a clear visualization of employee demographics and distribution patterns to:
- Understand workforce composition across various dimensions
- Track employee retention and termination rates
- Analyze geographical distribution of workforce
- Monitor gender and age diversity across departments

### Methodology
1. **Data Extraction & Transformation**
   - SQL Server as primary data source
   - Complex SQL queries for data aggregation
   - Power BI data modeling
   - DAX measures implementation

2. **Technical Architecture**
   - SQL Server Database → Power Query → Data Model → Power BI Visualizations
   - Git version control for report maintenance

## 2. Technical Implementation

### SQL Data Preparation
```sql
-- Employee Retention Rate Calculation
WITH EmployeeRetention AS (
    SELECT 
        Department,
        COUNT(*) as TotalEmployees,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 1 
              THEN 1 END) as RetainedEmployees
    FROM HR_Employee
    GROUP BY Department
)
SELECT 
    Department,
    CAST(ROUND(CAST(RetainedEmployees AS FLOAT) / 
         TotalEmployees * 100, 2) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) as RetentionRate
FROM EmployeeRetention;

-- Age Group Distribution
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, BirthDate, GETDATE()) < 25 THEN '18-24'
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, BirthDate, GETDATE()) < 35 THEN '25-34'
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, BirthDate, GETDATE()) < 45 THEN '35-44'
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, BirthDate, GETDATE()) < 55 THEN '45-54'
        ELSE '55-64'
    END as AgeGroup,
    COUNT(*) as EmployeeCount
FROM HR_Employee
GROUP BY CASE 
    WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, BirthDate, GETDATE()) < 25 THEN '18-24'
    WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, BirthDate, GETDATE()) < 35 THEN '25-34'
    WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, BirthDate, GETDATE()) < 45 THEN '35-44'
    WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, BirthDate, GETDATE()) < 55 THEN '45-54'
    ELSE '55-64'
END;
```

### Advanced DAX Implementation

```
// Dynamic YoY Growth Rate
YoY_Growth = 
VAR CurrentYear = CALCULATE(
    COUNT(Employees[EmployeeID]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(Calendar[Year]),
        Calendar[Year] = MAX(Calendar[Year])
    )
)
VAR PreviousYear = CALCULATE(
    COUNT(Employees[EmployeeID]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(Calendar[Year]),
        Calendar[Year] = MAX(Calendar[Year]) - 1
    )
)
RETURN
DIVIDE(CurrentYear - PreviousYear, PreviousYear, 0)

// Rolling 12-Month Retention Rate
Rolling_Retention = 
VAR CurrentDate = MAX(Calendar[Date])
VAR PriorYear = DATEADD(CurrentDate, -12, MONTH)
RETURN
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Employees[EmployeeID]),
        Employees[TerminationDate] > CurrentDate || 
        ISBLANK(Employees[TerminationDate]),
        Employees[HireDate] <= PriorYear
    ),
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(Employees[EmployeeID]),
        Employees[HireDate] <= PriorYear
    ),
    0
)

// Department Diversity Index
Diversity_Index = 
VAR GenderDiversity = DISTINCTCOUNT(Employees[Gender])
VAR RaceDiversity = DISTINCTCOUNT(Employees[Race])
VAR AgeDiversity = DISTINCTCOUNT(Employees[AgeGroup])
RETURN
(GenderDiversity + RaceDiversity + AgeDiversity) / 
COUNTROWS(VALUES(Employees[DepartmentID]))
```

### Data Model Optimization
1. **Star Schema Implementation**
   - Fact table: Employee metrics
   - Dimension tables: Department, Location, Time
   - Relationship optimization for performance

2. **Calculated Tables**
```
Date_Dim = 
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(DATE(2000,1,1), DATE(2024,12,31)),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "MonthNo", MONTH([Date]),
    "YearMonth", FORMAT([Date], "yyyy-mm"),
    "QuarterNo", QUARTER([Date]),
    "YearQuarter", YEAR([Date]) & " Q" & QUARTER([Date])
)
```
