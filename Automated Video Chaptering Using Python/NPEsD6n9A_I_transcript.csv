89.25,has a weight assigned weight is a
91.409,percentage describing how many questions
93.54,you will get from this specific section
96.06,in this case the weight distribution is
99.03,about equal that means every section is
101.7,equally important the bigger the section
103.86,the bigger the weight but overall you
106.5,will need to understand pretty much
107.97,every single area in order to pass the
110.61,exam please notice that describe key
112.92,word here because as part of this exam
115.049,you need to be able to both understand
117.329,but also understand well enough to be
119.939,able to describe each specific topic
122.159,covered by the exam one of the first
124.5,thing you should do when preparing for
125.939,this exam you should go to Microsoft
128.069,website and read high-level overview of
130.77,Microsoft Azure fundamental
132.36,certification
133.24,which will allow you to understand what
134.65,is the audience but also what are the
136.21,skills measured one of the things you
138.55,should do is scroll down to find a
140.2,skills measured section here you can

216.85,be sure that you understand but also
218.47,understand well enough to be able to
220.42,explain the topic to other people and
222.64,this is what will be covered and tested
